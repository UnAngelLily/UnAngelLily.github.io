Name of Project:
Pokedex

What does the app do?

The app allows the user to search for the Pokemon via number and also employs a carousel flip through them using back and forth arrows to toggle from one number to the next number.
It gives a picture of the creature with a few stats and a brief description

What did you use?
Basic html was used to format the page and while some CSS was used to style the background and placement of the divs on top of a picture along with the structure of the Pokemon's picture and description.
In the Javascript Jquery was used to pull data from an API to populate the provided information. For the arrow toggle a carousel was created.
More specifically, in order to create the carousel effect I defined x = 0 and x to be the userInput. This allowed the me to make different if loops for the two different buttons to go forwards and back.

What were the biggest wins?

There were a lot of different learning and exploring opportunities and I had a lot more knowledge to my disposal. While I had feedback and assistance from another cohort with the CSS and general pictures and display advice, getting the jquery click events to work was a trial in itself. I spent hours trying to understand why my expressions weren't working and trying to explain to myself why jquery and vanilla javascript were different and therefore giving me different information in the console log.

What were the biggest struggles?

The biggest struggles was putting things in the correct scope and practicing and learning how to communicate the different terms. I had a friend who participated in a backend bootcamp assist me in practicing communicating my code. He had no knowledge of Javascript let alone Jquery and I had to spend a lot of time explaining and finding quicker and easier ways to convey information back. I didn't realize how much my code vocabulary needed work since I still stumble on explaining fluidly what each piece of code is doing. In general, the knowledge is there but the recall still requires going back through notes and trying to carefully remember the correct terms for each part of the code.

Future plans with the application?

There were a lot of ideals I wanted to put into play, but ultimately I knew I had to prioritize the functionality of the app over the visual appearance and extra flare. I was most concerned with making sure the buttons not only worked, but wouldn't break while the user is trying to manipulate the app. While I am satisfied with the how the visual appearance of the app looks I would like to add more information to be pulled such as a descriptions of the Pokemon and locations where they can be found. I wanted to add sounds to the buttons to be similar to the Pokemon Go app and make it so that you can hold data from one Pokemon open so you can scroll or search to compare it to another Pokemon.

Anything else?

I would like to thank Maddy for providing feedback, motivation, and suggestions on making my app much more visually appealing. While I was a little discouraged to know that my API choice was popular I realized that no two codes will be the same. There were so many different paths to create a PokeDex with jQuery I can't imagine that any projects would have too many similarities. Just looking at the css and all the different visual choices helped me find a way to make my app, my own. I am particularly proud of my javascript code, even if it is simple, I chose what was easiest for me to read and comprehend.
